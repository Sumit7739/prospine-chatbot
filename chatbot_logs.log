Alright, so someone just said "hii". Hmm, I need to figure out how to respond. The user mentioned "hi", which is a friendly greeting. Since I'm Prospine, I should be helpful and empathetic.

Looking at the context provided earlier, it's about supporting users in their health-related questions, especially spine care and physiotherapy. But there's no information on hii or any specific topics related to hii. It could be a typo or someone asking something unexpected.

I don't have any predefined knowledge of hii, so I can't provide detailed info. My response should guide them towards the appropriate section if I had that context. Since I don't, it's best to say I'm sorry and ask for more details. That way, I maintain a friendly tone while keeping things open-ended.

I think using "Sorry" is appropriate here because it shows understanding without giving away too much. Maybe something like, "I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about hii." This keeps the conversation going and offers support if they're looking for more help.
</think>

I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about hii. Could you clarify or provide more details?
